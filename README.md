This is a simple, responsive article listing page created as part of a devChallenges.io front-end challenge. It features clean, semantic HTML and responsive layouts with media queries to adapt to different screen sizes.

### What I learned

- How to build a responsive layout using media queries.
- Improved my understanding of semantic HTML tags such as `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<time>`.
- Used Flexbox for layout structure and alignment.
- Learned how to structure a component-based layout for readability and scalability.

### Useful resources
